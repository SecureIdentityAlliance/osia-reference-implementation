This project contains examples of OSIA implementation:

- ``pr-mock``: a Population Registry mock implementing some services from the *PR* and *Data Access* interfaces.
- ``uin``: implementation of the OSIA *UIN Management* interface
- ``notification``: implementation of the OSIA *notification* interface
- ``orchestrator``: a service able to dispatch calls to OSIA interfaces in order to implement a Use Case
- ``cr-mock``: a set of scripts to simulate a Civil Registry interacting with the different servers according to the birth use case.

Those servers implement the birth Use Case described in ยง2.3.1 of OSIA specification.
The following exchanges are implemented:
